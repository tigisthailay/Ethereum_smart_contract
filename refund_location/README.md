# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

```shell
npx refund_location test
REPORT_GAS=true npx refund_location test
npx refund_location node
npx refund_location run scripts/deploycontract.js
```
